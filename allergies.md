## What are Your Food Allergies?

Sometimes, there are certain foods that we cannot eat because we are allergic to them. Other times, we want to cut out certain foods for dietary reasons. If you have allergies to certain foods or specific dietary restrictions and would like to see some possible alternatives, whether it is for eating, cooking, or something else, input them below and a list of alternatives will appear!

Make sure that if you have multiple food allergies/dietary restrictions to separate each of them with a comma.

Common food allergies/dietary restrictions include, but are not limited to:  
    - Dairy  
    - Gluten  
    - Nuts  
    - Meat (chicken, fish, beef, pork, etc.)  
    - Eggs
